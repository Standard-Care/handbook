#### How We Operate
We are a remote first organization. Processes and tooling are set up to ensure a high level of transparency and accountability across the organization, regardless of whether an employee is on-site or remote. 

Employees local to the SF Bay Area have the option to work from HQ. However, employees can work remotely from home, a coffee shop, or wherever they are most efficient, provided their work is getting done. 

For the 100% remote team members, they can work from anywhere during business hours as long as they are available online for calls. 

#### Performance Management
* Monthly we will revise SMART goals for teams and individuals. Are are too nascent for a formal ORK system.
* Updates will be made continuosly and confirmed in manager 1:1s
* All-hands meetings that are fornightly include OKR progress updates, announcements, discussions of hot topics, and an open Q&A forum.

##### Individual Performance Review
   As per best practices and quality system procedures leadership continuously assesses competence. This is a suggested agenda for routine 1-on-1 meetings:
   
- Review context:
    - Personal context
    - Key business updates
 - Performance versus OKRs
 - Feedback about organizational systems & processes (not shared in company retro meetings)
 - Performance feedback for management; start/stop/continue
 - Career planning; near-term & long-term
 
 This will be summarized in an annual review.

#### Headquarters
* We have not physical office, but our corporate entity is headquarter in Berkeley, CA, USA

##### Focused Work and Asynchronous Communication
- We support being “in the zone” ([deep focused work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d66815uVerk))
- We capture and track work in organized tasks
- We communicate openly in shared digital forums (Slack)

Our employees work varied hours from many global locations. This creates several asynchronous workflows that we strive to use to our advantage and allows great autonomy for individual contributors. Team and all-hands meetings are generally clustered during centralized ‘core hours’ so all who are needed can attend as per their normal work schedules.

Internalize the lesson of [this cartoon](https://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/) by [@detly](https://github.com/detly)

It's better for everyone’s concentration and sanity if we collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not immediately. The preferred first choice of action should be to post a message, a to-do, or a document about what we need explained or need to know. Then others can respond when they’re available.

There are exceptions. Live collaboration is sometimes needed for intricate design or to just spend time with another human processing a problem.

Teams that collaborate heavily should plan for more overlap. Async generally should bias for "Deep Work" to improve santiy and productivity.

* Communication Norms    
We use Slack as our main tool for communication. During their respective business hours, all employees should be available via Slack. 

* AFK (Away From Keyboard)    
Life happens, just notify your team on Slack and/or via the Shared calendar that you won’t be available and for approximately how long.

* #signoff
Async, remote teams have struggled to find a meeting schedule that works for deep work across timezones. We are borrowing the #signoff channel. Rather than a stand-up in the morning (since it's different for everyone). Post an updates in #signoff of what you completed that day along with a heads up on blockers and if you like a link to a GitHub issue or pull request you would like reviewed by the next morning.

#### IRL (In Real Life)
We will host in-person gatherings as budget and public health emergencies permit.
